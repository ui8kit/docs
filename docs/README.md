## Core Concept

UI8Kit/Core embodies **minimalism**: complex interfaces can be built using just **15 composite components** and **12 reusable variants** that cover ~80% of design scenarios. This provides minimal code footprint, eliminates redundant classes, and enables unlimited design-flexible layouts.

## Features

- ✅ Three-layered architecture aligned with atomic design
- ✅ CVA-based (class-variance-authority) variant system
- ✅ Prop forwarding API for extended components
- ✅ Tailwind CSS utility-first approach
- ✅ TypeScript support with full type safety
- ✅ Multiple integration formats (npm, registry, submodule, source)

## Project Structure

- **Core/UI** - Basic primitives and foundational components
- **Components/UI** - Composite components with extended functionality
- **Layouts** - Pre-built layout templates and systems
